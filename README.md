This website runs best on screen resolution - 1366x768

Among the functionalities - Add Algorithm button should be clickable and add a new field with half pre-defined fields like version and timeline that can be edited. The cluster dropdown field should be working and should have at least 10 entries with a scroll starting from 5 entries. The header tabs Best Model and All Models should also be working and you can leave the below section empty but the click should work. The Close icon in each section should remove the section from the list
